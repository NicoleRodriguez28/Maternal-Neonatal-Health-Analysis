# Infant Health & Maternal Smoking Analysis
## Overview
This project explores the relationship between maternal behaviors—particularly smoking during pregnancy—and infant health outcomes using the **babies** dataset from the **moderndive** package. The goal is to understand how factors such as maternal smoking status, education, income, race, and age influence infant birth weight and gestation period.

## Why It Matters
Maternal health behaviors and socioeconomic factors play a crucial role in determining infant outcomes. This analysis is important because it sheds light on how smoking during pregnancy and related demographic factors affect birth weight and gestation. By identifying these patterns, we can support targeted public health interventions and raise awareness around maternal health risks.

## Key Insights
- Mothers who did not smoke during pregnancy had infants with higher birth weights.
- Higher birth weights were also associated with higher maternal education and income.
- Smoking was more common among younger, less educated, and lower-income mothers.
- White mothers had the highest average infant birth weights, followed by Black mothers.
